Project Yamhill is the successor to the Willamette Transceiver, also known as the qrp-l Group Project. The purpose of this endeavor is to provide a platform to learn about radio electronics at a system level. Modules that correspond to the blocks of a block diagram will be the basis upon which different types of radio designs will be created. A modular 3D printed backplane will be the chassis, user interface, and power supply for the radio experiments. The desired goal is to have a high-performance CW QRP transceiver at the end of the main project run, however there would be the capacity to build many other types of radios from the blocks as desired, such as a SSB transceiver, run more transmit power with a linear amplifier that can provide 20 watts or more, data radio, simple receiver, different architectures such as a phasing receiver, etc.

All designs and code will be permissively open sourced so that an end user is able to build one by himself if desired. All radio design specifications will be published, along with detailed information about how the user can make his own measurements with affordable test equipment to ensure that his radio is performing as expected. Basic build information will be freely available, however for detailed instructions, please subscribe to my Substack, details below.

## Substack Community
Detailed build, test, and alignment instructions will be posted on my Substack, [Applied Etherics](https://nt7s.substack.com/). You'll also find support and the build community there.

## Architecture
The system architecture white paper can be found [here](YamhillArchitecture.md).
