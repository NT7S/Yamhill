# Project Yamhill 3D Print Notes

The Project Yamhill backplane was designed so that it could printed on a consumer-grade FDM 3D printer. Since the total size of the backplane is 350 mm x 360 mm, the backplane is composed of four modular sections that are connected together with support brackets and M3x5 screws. Two right side and two left side modules comprise the entire base of the backplane. The front panel is secured to the front of the backplane using pairs of support brackets connected to screw holes on the vertical side of the backplane blocks.

## Material
This backplane is designed to be printed in PETG filament, although other materials such as ABS may work as well. PLA is not recommened due to its unsuitable properties for affixing screws directly to it. PLA may be usable if you modify the screw holes to accept brass heat-set inserts.
